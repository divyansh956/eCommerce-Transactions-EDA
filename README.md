# eCommerce Transactions Dataset - Data Science Assignment

This repository contains the solution to the **eCommerce Transactions Dataset** assignment. The assignment involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building a lookalike model, and performing customer segmentation using the provided dataset. The dataset includes three CSV files: **Customers.csv**, **Products.csv**, and **Transactions.csv**.

## Tasks Covered

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization on the provided dataset.
- Derived actionable business insights from the dataset.

### 2. **Lookalike Model**
- Built a model to recommend 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
- Assigned similarity scores to the recommended customers.

### 3. **Customer Segmentation**
- Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers using both profile and transaction data.
- Calculated clustering metrics (e.g., DB Index) and visualized the clusters.

## Deliverables
- **EDA Report**: Insights from the dataset with a PDF and Jupyter Notebook.
- **Lookalike Model**: Model code and a CSV file containing recommended customers with similarity scores.
- **Clustering**: Report and Jupyter Notebook for customer segmentation, including clustering metrics and visualizations.
